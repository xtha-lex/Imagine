    <h1>Imagine by John Lennon</h1>
    <p class="verse">Imagine there's no heaven<br>
    It's easy if you try<br>
    No hell below us<br>
    Above us only sky<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Living for today... Aha-ah...</p>

    <p class="verse">Imagine there's no countries<br>
    It isn't hard to do<br>
    Nothing to kill or die for<br>
    And no religion, too<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Living life in peace... You...</p>

    <p class="chorus">You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
    But I'm not the only one<br>
    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
    And the world will be as one</p>

    <p class="verse">Imagine no possessions<br>
    I wonder if you can<br>
    No need for greed or hunger<br>
    A brotherhood of man<br>
    Imagine all the people<br>
    Sharing all the world... You...</p>

    <p class="chorus">You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
    But I'm not the only one<br>
    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
    And the world will live as one</p>
